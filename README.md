## Introduction

This Router Simulator is a tool designed to help users simulate and understand the behavior of computer network routers. Whether you're a student studying networking concepts or a professional looking to test network configurations, this simulator can be a valuable resource.

## Features

- **Topology Setup**: Create custom network topologies by adding routers and connecting them with links.

- **Packet Routing**: Simulate the routing of packets between routers, allowing you to see how data travels through a network.

- **Routing Protocols**: Choose from various routing protocols (e.g., OSPF, BGP) to observe their impact on routing decisions.

- **Packet Capture**: Analyze packet traffic with packet capture functionality, helping you troubleshoot network issues.

- **Statistics**: View statistics on packet latency, throughput, and other network performance metrics.

## Getting Started

1. **Installation**: Clone this repository or download the Router Simulator executable.

2. **Run the Simulator**: Launch the simulator application.

3. **Create a Topology**: Use the GUI to create a network topology by adding routers and links between them.

4. **Configure Routers**: Set up router configurations, including routing protocols and IP addresses.

5. **Start Simulation**: Begin the simulation to observe packet routing and network behavior.

## Usage

- **Topology Editor**: Use the built-in topology editor to create and modify network topologies.

- **Packet Routing**: Start the simulation and observe how packets move through the network.

- **Capture Packets**: Use the packet capture feature to inspect packet contents and troubleshoot issues.
